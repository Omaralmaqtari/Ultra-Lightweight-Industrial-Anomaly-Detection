# Ultra-Lightweight-Industrial-Anomaly-Detection (UL_IAD)

This is the official implementation of the proposed model in the paper "Ultra Lightweight Industrial Anomaly Detection: A Dynamic Memory Approch with Multi Attention Mechanisms".

The model was trained and tested on the three Anomaly datasets (MVTec_AD, BTAD, DAGM), links to the datasets are below:

1. MVTec_AD: (https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad)
2. BTAD: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thtuan/btad-beantech-anomaly-detection)
3. DAGM: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mhskjelvareid/dagm-2007-competition-dataset-optical-inspection)
